/**
 * Implements the Orienteering component, as described by the paper "GRT: Program-Analysis-Guided
 * Random Testing" by Ma et. al (appears in ASE 2015):
 * https://people.kth.se/~artho/papers/lei-ase2015.pdf .
 *
 * <p>Biases input selection towards sequences that have lower execution cost. Execution cost is
 * measured by the number of method calls in a sequence and the time it takes to execute.
 *
 * <p>Our implementation of Orienteering differs from that described in the GRT paper in that we do
 * not keep track of the execution time of an input sequence for each new run. Instead, we assume
 * that an input sequence's execution time is equal to the execution time of its first run. We
 * believe this assumption is reasonable since we do not expect an input sequence's execution time
 * to differ greatly between separate runs.
